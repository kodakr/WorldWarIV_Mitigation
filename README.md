# WorldWar4Mitigation
*“I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones” - Albert Einstein*

## Brief Description

WorldWar4Mitigation is a blockchain-based project whose high level aim is preventing Earth (currently at War) from reaching a World war 4 state. Project intends impacting solution from a first principle or lowest possible level. The root cause of conflicts is Disagreement. Disagreement is due to inefficiency in reaching consensus.
Leveraging blockchain technology, **WorldWar4Mitigation** dispenses a consensus-reaching medium generously and ubiquitously at all levels of human existence. It allows transparent and tamper-proof, ensuring fairness and inclusivity in decision-making / consensus-reaching processes.
The project provides this solution by implementing a **factory** which dispenses efficiently (Using Assembly and create2) a "consensus medium" to anyone. Giving no room for manipulation by centralization or even the Admin.
Skillfully crafted to adapt to diverse heirachical scenarios, from family decisions to governance matters, potentially revolutionizing how decisions are made globally. 
Described to be Malleable, ubiquitous and all-purpose. 
Robust
## Project solution Instances
Examples of solution provided:
- A mum can use to decide efficiently and strictly within all family members if to go for a Mac, hp or Del. (...can still refer to this decisions outcome 10 years later using her uniqueId **ChainlinkVRFv2 generated**).
- Rome / Cardinals can decide for its pope.
- A Nation can deploy to decide its state governorship election.
- Chainlink internal Board members / judges can use to decide if  members think **WorldWar4Mitigation**   by next 5 years can be utilized for National Presidential Election by The United States and top European countries. 
Code is robust.
## Project Features
1. All-purpose nature
    - Robustly implemented for all demands.
2. Archive and Transparency
    - Factory automatically tracks and stores result of all instances.
    - 20 years later, can retrieve consensus made today and for all instances.
3. Interoperability
    - End user can cast vote from convinient chain.
4. Signature enabled participation.
    - My grandma can participate without paying gas.
    - enhanes efficiency in a mass voting scenario eg: Government elections.
5. A "Live Television" feature:
    - Anyone can view current state of consensus while voting is ongoing.
## Chainlink Integrations
1. **ChainlinkVRFv2**
    - for unique identification, tracking and future retrieval of all instances.
    - Ensures distinct `bytes32 _uniqueId` for all instances.
2. **Chainlink CCIP**
    - Enabling anyone to vote from convinient chain.

#### Beware
Perhaps unnecessary but worthy of note:
The impact of this project is not specific to a niche of humans (eg: DeFi) but rather a project impacting all humans currently on earth and will ever be. 
A gift from the constellations to "The Constellations" as its role in mitigating World War IV. A psychic Intervention.
